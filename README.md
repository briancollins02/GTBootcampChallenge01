# <Challenge 01 - Accessibility>

## Description

This repo was created as a way to practice using semantic HTML for the sake of accessability and cleaning up code. previous to my work, the HTML was comprised of almost entirely non-semantic elements. Now, because of the work done, the webpage should be correctly read with a screen-reader. I learned a lot about semantic HTML and how it makes the site accessable to those with disabilities, but also the people working on the code. a wall of divs are difficult to read, but semantic elements make parcing the processes a much simpler task.
